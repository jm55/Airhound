# NSSECU2 Project

The hacking tool is specifically designed for use in WiFi hacking purposes. Most of the internal functionalities of the project use built-in 802.11 tools of Kali, most of which can be found on the Aircrack-ng suite. The tool can conduct basic WiFi Scanning, WPA/2 Handshake Capture, WPA/2 Cracking, and WiFi Denial of Service/Deauth Attacks.

Additionally, BT reconnaissance was also added since it also belongs under Wireless Hacking.
